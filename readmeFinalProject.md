Title: Password Generator
Description: A program that will generate strong password(s) for you.
Type in your name as well as birth month, day, and year followed by age.
You can use numbers or words for all of the above inputs.
Then fill in how many passwords and of what length you want to generate.
Finally click on the 'Generate' button to generate the list of passwords.
Strong passwords will be displayed in a new window.

During the process of creating this program, I realized that I could
build a better program if I changed some of the components I had planned
on using in milestone 0. As such, I used replace instead of append to
make changes to elements in the password that include the user's personal
information. In the place of a list, I created separate variables to hold
the personal information of the user. I have used multiple functions,
including one which has a parameter, multiple if/else statements, a while
loop, a for loop, and multiple GUI windows.

This  program requires the random, string, and tkinter modules to run.

If I had more time, I would have added a radio button to the GUI that would
let the user decide if they want to use special characters or not.
